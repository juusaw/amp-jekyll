# amp-jekyll

Jekyll plugin for creating Accelerated Mobile Page versions of posts. Supports Jekyll version 3.

[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/amp-jekyll.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/amp-jekyll)

[AMP project](https://www.ampproject.org/)

### Usage

#### Using the gem
- Add gem `amp-jekyll` to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle`
- Add the gem to your `_config.yml` like this:

```yml
gems:
  - amp-jekyll
```

#### Adding the plugin manually
- Place the Ruby files in `lib/jekyll` (`amp_generate.rb` and `amp_filter.rb`) in folder _plugins at the root of the project


#### Then perform the following
- Place the layout file (`amp.html`) to the _layouts folder
- Add `amphtml`-link to post heads (see page linking below)
(Add CSS styles to the html template)
- Generate your site with `jekyll build`

### Setting things up

The AMP standard is somewhat restrictive on allowed HTML elements and requires some extra information on element placing. To make sure that your generated AMP pages are valid by the standard, you can run the AMP version of your post with **#development=1** appended to the URL and check the browser's Javascript console for the validation.

Several HTML elements must be replaced with tags specified in the AMP specs to ensure compatibility with the standard. The `amp_filter.rb` Jekyll filter replaces the tags after converting the markdown to HTML. At the moment only replacing `<img>` tags is supported.

To disable image responsivity, add false to `amp_images` responsive parameter in amp.html. This is enabled by default for header and footer.

### The AMP folder
Specify amp folder in `_config.yml` as `ampdir: YOURDIR`

### Page linking
The easiest solution is adding the following conditional expression around the tag.

```
{% if page.path contains '_posts' %}
  <link rel="amphtml" href="{{ page.id | prepend: '/YOURDIR' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">
{% endif %}
```

### CSS
CSS rules for AMP must be included inline in the `<style amp-custom>` tag in the `<head>` element in the HTML. You can write the CSS rules by hand or use jekyll includes. Do note that the AMP specification forbids the use of some CSS selectors and attributes. Because of this, it is not a good idea to include the main stylesheet by default.

### Skipping Pages

Sometimes there are pages we don't want to be turned into AMP pages, normally this is because they require HTML elements or JavaScript that would make them invalid.

In any post we want to skip simply add;

```yml
skip_amp: true
```

And update your `amphtml` block to look like;

```
{% if page.path contains '_posts' %}
  {% unless page.skip_amp %}
    <link rel="amphtml" href="{{ page.id | prepend: '/YOURDIR' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">
  {% endunless %}
{% endif %}
```

# Build Speed

Pages are processed using several threads to try and minimise build speed. The number of threads can be configured by setting `ENV['THREADCOUNT']`. By default 4 threads are used.
